Two Lights Flashing Morse Code Letter "D"
April 14 (?), 1953
Sea of Japan

Brad Sparks:
April 14 [?], 1953. Sea of Japan
9:23-11:50 p.m. (Japan time UTC+9). Navy Pacific Fleet P2V Neptune [probably P2V-3W electronic 
ferret ELINT spy] aircraft flying at 9,000 ft [and ~200 mph] observed 2 bright lights flashing in 
[Morse?] code letter "D." The 2 unidentified aircraft paced the P2V from a position [radar-tracked] 
about 12 miles away to a point (at 41°45’N, 132°20’E heading towards N Korea) where 3 additional 
unidentified aircraft joined. All unidentified aircraft closed to 3 miles when the P2V descended 
to 2,000 ft. At 10:43 p.m. the P2V turned (SE and away from N Korea) and flew towards Japan to 
39°05’N, 136°33’E, descending to 400 ft above the ocean. At least 5 more unidentified aircraft 
joined making a minimum total of 10 UFO’s. Night was extremely dark with ceiling and visibility 
unlimited. No recognition features on the unidentified aircraft were observed except [what was 
interpreted as] an occasional jet glow. From 10:43 p.m. until about 11:50 p.m. the P2V was the 
target of at least “70 aggressive non-firing passes.” Unidentified aircraft formed a group and 
departed when the P2V was about 100 (NM?) miles off Niigata, Japan [thus at about 38°45’N, 137°12’E]. 
UFO tactics were to have one UFO on the P2V's quarter at about 7 miles away. The other UFO’s made 
“high speed runs,” some from abeam of the P2V but most from astern (behind the P2V) all passing 
under the P2V still flying at 400 feet. At least 10 passes were made by 4 UFO’s in formation with 
runs from astern all passing below the P2V. The P2V was on an ECM mission [=ELINT mission] at the 
time of the interception. Five cuts [= ELINT Direction-Finding D/F intercepts] were obtained with 
at least 3 of these emanating from UFO’s confirmed by radar. UFO Signal characteristics: frequency 
2790 MHz, PRF 500 - 550 Hz (or pulses per second) and PW (pulse width or duration) 11.5 microseconds.

Fran Ridge:
Very important case, a bombshell! And not listed on the April 1953 Sightings (listing). *

Jan Aldrich:
So here we have a Soviet AW&C type plane and about 10 fighters making over 70 passes at a Navy 
plane? The closest base would probably have been North Korea. So the fighters have to fly to the 
Navy plane, use lots of fuel making LOW LEVEL passes and then fly back. Fuel consumption would have 
to be huge! Pretty good in 1953! Now would the AF and the Navy be very concerned about such a jump 
in technology? Passing under a.plane flying at 400 feet at night. That's some good flying.
