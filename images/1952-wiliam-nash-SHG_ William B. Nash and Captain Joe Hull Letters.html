<p class="txt">Dear Captain Nash:</p>

<p>
Your interesting letter of October 19 which contained your first
draft of a rebuttal to my story on the flying saucers was forwarded
to me by Ed Modes, Editor of THE AIR LINE PILOT, for reply.&nbsp;  I
returned only yesterday from a vacation in Mexico.&nbsp; Otherwise your
letter would have had my prompt attention.
</p>
<p>
It is doubtful if any subject which has been so widely discussed
and written about is held in so many different lights as the
fabulous "flying saucers".&nbsp; As a man who believes implicitly that
he saw several of these elusive objects in flight, your resentment
against my article on Dr. Menzel's book is both understandable
and pardonable.&nbsp; I really do respect your feelings on the subject as
much as any of the hundreds of people whom I have interviewed on
these fascinating but nebulous will-o-the-wisps.&nbsp; It may interest
you to know that you are at least the 30th pilot who has told me
personally he saw one or more flying saucers.&nbsp; At least half a dozen
Capital pilots are among this group, men that I know intimately and
that I know to be reliable.&nbsp; And on two occasions &ndash; both times at
night &ndash; I was an unbelieving witness myself to strange
manifestations in the sky that were clearly visible from the
cockpit.
</p>
<p>
Your letter indicates that my research which I claimed was untiring
for over five years was not as thorough as it might have been.&nbsp; This
is quite possibly true.&nbsp; It is obvious to me that it has not been as
complete as either Donald Keyhoe's or Professor Menzel's.&nbsp; But it
has been practical and I too, have compiled quite a file on
purported sightings, both from personal contact and from everything
I could find in print on the subject.&nbsp; Nothing in my entire life has
ever captured my imagination more and if anything was published on
the subject of flying saucers which I did not immediately purchase
and read, it was simply because it was either unavailable to me as
a civilian or else it escaped my notice in the hustle and bustle of
everyday life.&nbsp; I even read all the fiction that is written about
the disks, watch all the TV shows, many of which doted on this
theme during the past three years.
</p>
<p>
You will wonder how a man who claims to have once been a sincere,
believing addict of the esoteric saucer cult could turn heretic,
especially in the light of the preponderance of evidence that
flying saucers do exist.&nbsp; Six years is a long time to be devoted to
a belief and it was not just Dr. Menzel's book which swung me
overnight, as it were.&nbsp; Quite a while ago I began to have misgivings
about all the self-styled experts on the subject, and it was Dr.
Menzel's book which provided me with the "deliverance" which I
sought from something which I did not understand and could not
escape.&nbsp; Perhaps it is as you put it so aptly in your article.&nbsp;
People do unconsciously try to dismiss things which they fear and
do not want to exist.&nbsp; Heaven help us if these things are from outer
space as Keyhoe believes!&nbsp; We shall certainly find ourselves at the
mercy of a race of creatures who are vastly superior
to us earthbound mortals, both in scientific intellect and in
physical capabilities.
</p>
<p>
I am happy to announce that your article last year in TRUE magazine
was not one of those which obviously escaped my attention.&nbsp; I read
it with rapt attention and it held me spellbound until the very
last word.&nbsp; But I must confess that it did give rise to a few
questions in my mind which I will take the liberty here of putting
to you.
</p>
<br>
<p class="txt">
<b>William B. Nash, Miami Florida, November 2, 1953 &nbsp; Page 2</b>
</p>
 <br>
  <br>
<p>
As I remember your article, you were cruising southbound at 8000
feet near Newport News, Virginia when this flight of UFO’s (as ATIC
calls them) passed beneath your DC-4.&nbsp; You state unequivocally that
they were &quot;100 feet in diameter, 2000 feet above sea level, and
they covered 50 miles in 12 seconds&quot;.&nbsp; If you will pardon my
impudence, you sound more like a surveyor than an airline pilot.&nbsp;
Pray tell me, how do you know the diameter, how did you know the
altitude?&nbsp; I will grant you that if given these two statistics it
would not be difficult to ascertain the approximate speed.&nbsp; I
realize that Pan American pilots are specially trained in celestial
navigation and that most of you have better mathematical educations
than is required by domestic airlines, but even so, something more
than that is required before you can state with complete impunity
that you saw a group of unknown objects <b>after night</b> racing
into the heavens at the utterly incredible speed of 15,000 miles
per hour.&nbsp; It is a well known fact that big league ball players
strike out because they are unable to follow the flight of a
baseball from the hand of a fast ball pitcher thrown at a <b>measly
100 miles per hour</b>.&nbsp; It is difficult to follow so small an
object as a baseball but it is at only 90 feet distance.&nbsp; Even a man
with all his faculties has trouble following the high speed flight
of a modern jet only a mile away in the daylight.&nbsp; To me it is
beyond comprehension that you saw what you believe you saw.&nbsp; And
there is not an optician anywhere, even if he is fitting glasses on
coal miners in Kentucky, who will believe you.
</p>
<p>
There were many things about Dr. Menzel’s book which I could not
endorse.&nbsp; His theory of the bumps and dents in the leading edge of
an airfoil causing a burble which could refract sunlight
through snow crystals in the burble is absurd.&nbsp; His picture of this
alleged occurrence was equally scientifically unfounded and
undoubtedly only a straight reflection of sunlight into the camera.&nbsp;
But to his everlasting tribute, it must be pointed out that he and
he alone did bring to the attention of his readers just how
misleading our senses can be.&nbsp; My article pointed out that he <b>did
not deny</b> the purported sightings; he merely believes and tries
to interpret them as something other than flying saucers.&nbsp; Of course,
he could not explain a certain percentage of the sightings.&nbsp; <b>But
to this date neither has any other man on this earth</b> and this
includes Donald Keyhoe, Gerald Heard, Frank Scully (a lousy,
reprehensible fraud), General Samford and a host of others.&nbsp; Every
one of these men are postulating and in varying degrees.&nbsp; They are
all sincerely and determinedly trying with every resource at their
command to get to the bottom of this fantastic mystery which has
both entertained and struck fear at the hearts of mankind.&nbsp; I should
not include Scully — he should have been prosecuted for the
redolent brand of yellow journalism which his tome represents so
well.&nbsp; All Dr. Menzel did was to join a long list of people striving
to solve this enigma which has plagued us for so long.&nbsp; Everybody
else has a theory; he is entitled to his, even though succeeding
events may prove him wrong.&nbsp; But if he does turn out to be mistaken, his error
will not be a culpable one, which is more than can be said for some of the
hoaxsters which have preyed on the gullible.
</p>
<p>
I am quite sure that the columns of THE AIR LINE PILOT are open to
you to express your views, just as it is to any member in good
standing.&nbsp; Since the reorganization of ALPA it has emerged from a
sordid, almost disgraceful past into one of the most dignified and
democratic labor unions extant.&nbsp; I doubt if you can find an equal
for it anywhere in the labor world.&nbsp; I am now proud (for the first
time in years) to be a member of this magnificent organization and
I have made myself a promise to dedicate my services to it in any
way its officers see fit to use them.&nbsp; My present capacity, as a
contributing columnist has been undertaken with a great deal of
verve, but for one purpose: To make the magazine a little more
readable, a little more enjoyable to the members.&nbsp; That a columnist
will find many who disagree with him is inevitable.&nbsp; But that is a
calculated risk to which I agreed when I accepted ALPA’s invitation
to join its staff as a contributing writer.&nbsp; There is no recompense
in the job except personal satisfaction; certainly there is always
abundant criticism.&nbsp; But as long as it comes from sincere readers such
as you it will always be welcome.&nbsp;  By all means, do not become
discouraged because Keyhoe beat you to the draw.&nbsp; Ask for a new airing
of your views.&nbsp; I am sure we shall all find it interesting reading.
</p>
<p>
For me, the flying saucers do not constitute a closed chapter in my
life.&nbsp; While I am not an agnostic I still think I will wait and see.
And somehow or other, I must confess to you that there are times
when I hope I am wrong.&nbsp; Chasing these things has been a lot of fun.

211-06 75th. Ave.<br>
Bayslde, New York

</p>
<br>

<p class="txt">Dear Captain Hull:</p>
<p>
Many thanks for the reply to my letter, and the further expression
of your views on the flying saucers.&nbsp; It is always interesting to
learn about the viewpoint and reasoning of other persons, and I am
always susceptible to change if the evidence produced is
sufficiently logical.
</p>
<p>
If my method of expression in this reply sometimes seems too biting,
please accept my apologies in advance.&nbsp; It is merely my old debating
team method of expression, and I am an adherent to Bob Taft’s
belief that tact is dishonesty in disguise.&nbsp; The feelings I express
here are not intended to be personal, because, in general, I admire
your work and intelligence, but are the answers I would give anyone
under similar circumstances.
</p>
<p>
One of my outstanding criticisms of columnists (and I have written
to many of them} is that they feel that they must fill up that
column whether or not they have sufficient time to get the truth
straight, and all of the facts that they employ carefully checked.&nbsp;
They have a big responsibility, and considerable influence upon the
thinking of the readers, hence they should be very exacting.
</p>
<p>
If it happens to be true, even though you do not presently believe
it, that the saucers are space craft from another planet, the Air
Line Pilots, of all groups of people on this Earth, should be
ready with all that is known about these reports to date.&nbsp; They
should not be discouraged from further investigation, but should be
encouraged to read and think about every bit of information
available.&nbsp; Now your letter to me, and your article does not express
your feelings in the same manner.
</p>
<p>
The article definitely gives the impression that Doc Menzel changed
your mind;&nbsp; "Dr. Menzel once and for all, explodes all the silly
notions I have shared with millions of other people.”&nbsp; Also, in your
letter you admit that; "I must confess to you that there are times
when I hope I am wrong.&nbsp; Chasing these things has been a lot of fun".&nbsp;
Why not admit this in the article?&nbsp; It is obviously your honest
opinion.&nbsp; Hence why the bum steer to the public?
</p>
<p>
Also you did not express your true feelings about Menzel's
explanations. Your article lead people to think that his scientific
explanations were just next to perfect.&nbsp; Yet to me you have admitted
that you did not agree with all of his theories. It is a bit
neglectful to leave such statements out of such an article.&nbsp; Then,
of course, you were not very exacting in your research as to who
Keyhoe is, and published a false impression there too.&nbsp; You could
have picked up any TRUE, looked in the front and have noted that
John DuBarry is the Aviation Editor of TRUE.&nbsp; This fact is also
mentioned in Keyhoe's
</p>
<br>
<center>
<strong>2.</strong>
</center>
  <br>

<p class="txt">
first saucer book, "THE FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL" (all the way thru
the book, because the book was a description of Keyhoe's research for
DuBarry on contract to write an article of similar title for TRUE)&nbsp;
If you read the saucer books as "voraciously" as you said in your
article, you couldn't have missed that fact.&nbsp; Perhaps your reading
is precis style &ndash; but you should re-read in detail before writing.&nbsp;
That is your responsibility as a columnist.
</p>
<p>
You made similar gross errors in reading the article I wrote for
TRUE.&nbsp; Naturally, I have a copy, and you should too, if all is true
about your "tireless research".&nbsp; I also have been a tireless
researcher and have kept copies of all material I could get whether
pro or con on the subject.
</p>
<p>
In your letter you state that I said "unequivocally" that the
objects were 100 feet in diameter, 2000 ft. above sea level, and
they covered 50 miles in 12 seconds".
</p>
<p>
 Frankly, that's another example of rather poor reading on your part.&nbsp;
I quote here directly from the article;&nbsp; "We <b>judged</b> the
objects' diameter to be a little larger than a DC-3 wingspread
would appear to be &ndash; about 100 feet &ndash; at their altitude which we
<b>estimated</b> at slightly more than a mile below us, or about
2000 feet above ground level".&nbsp; Now when I modify our estimates with
such words as <b>judged</b>, and <b>estimated</b>,  how the hell
can you say our statements were "unequivocally" made?&nbsp; As to your
question, "Pray tell me, how did you know the diameter, how did you
know the altitude?", you can see by accurate reading that we did
not say that we <b>Knew</b>, but we did give the method by which we
<b>judged</b>.&nbsp; I have been flying since 1929.&nbsp;
Before the War I flew with U.A.L.  &ndash; then quit and joined PAA, spent 2
&frac12; years in the NATS, then returned to PAA.&nbsp; Most of my almost
11,000 hours have been flown at either 7000 feet or 8000 feet,
until I just recently changed to DC6B's.&nbsp; Therefore, I and most
other PAA pilots are well experienced at estimating the height of
objects beneath them &ndash; from these altitudes.&nbsp;
If you or any other airline pilot of some experience cannot roughly
determine whether or not an object is half-way between you and the
ground from that altitude, and be able to split that again into
quarters, he should go back to the farm.&nbsp; How many times have you
looked at a plane below you and felt that you knew that he was
halfway between you and the ground, or that he was only &frac14; up from
the ground toward your own craft?&nbsp; No matter what the planes size
&ndash; even unfamiliar sizes &ndash; I think you could do it pretty accurately.&nbsp;
When we felt that we had the height pretty well tied down, we
separately tried to estimate their size &ndash; and the nearest
comparison was, as described in the article, a DC-3 wingspread.&nbsp; Both
Bill Fortenberry and I have been in the Navy, and are still in the
reserve.&nbsp; Both of us have received in Naval training long
identification courses until we could identify a picture flashed on
a screen in 1/10th and 1/100th of a second as to number of planes
in a squadron, whose they were, and what type.&nbsp; We learned
to do the same thing with ships, and to identify every ship in the
German Navy.&nbsp; Twelve seconds, compared to 1/10th is a considerable time.&nbsp;
Let it run on your stop-watch and see for yourself.

<p>
Your example about a baseball being difficult to see does not in
the least relate to the sighting we had.&nbsp; The distance is short and
the ball is coming almost at the batter's head.&nbsp; You also say that a
man with all his faculties has difficulty following the speed of a

<p class="txt">
high speed jet a mile away in the daylight.&nbsp; Frankly, I do not have
difficulty keeping my eye on any jet made today when it is a mile
above me at 5000 feet, and if any pilot does, he'd best retire, too.
</p>
<p>
Regarding our determination of the speed of the things, we were as
conservative as we could possibly be.&nbsp; They appeared first about ten
miles beyond Newport News.&nbsp; We had our position exactly by visual
reference, and by being on the leg of the VHF range of Norfolk.&nbsp; (I
don’t have to be a surveyor for that knowledge &ndash; just a navigator)&nbsp;
The objects came toward our plane in a straight line, changed
direction under us and went away in a straight line across another
suburban edge of the <b>same</b> city, then were in sight for
perhaps 30 miles more as they climbed steeply after passing the
city of Newport News a second time.&nbsp; Add the <b>estimated</b>
mileage.&nbsp; The city was 25 miles from us.&nbsp; That's a 50 mile round trip.&nbsp;
Then add the 10 & the 30 miles we estimated <b>beyond</b> the city
that they had travelled in each direction.&nbsp; That's 90 miles.&nbsp; To be
conservative, we only used the 50 miles, because we could only be
sure of that much.&nbsp; We had <b>seen</b> them travel <b>at least</b>
that distance.&nbsp; As to time, that was more difficult.&nbsp; We didn't want
to guess, so we re-enacted seven different times exactly what we
had done and said during the experience, even to unfastening the
safety belt, and exclaiming "What the hell is that?" at their
initial appearance.&nbsp; Each time, the time period did not exceed 12
seconds but to be on the conservative side again, we decided to use
15 seconds in the computation.&nbsp; The speed would be 12,000 miles per
hour with conservative figures.&nbsp; Add more time and cut the distance
in half if you want to &ndash; It's <b>still</b> a few thousand over our
achievements.&nbsp; And as I said in the copy of my article answering
yours.&nbsp; The things were <b>not</b> reflections, marinated ice
crystals or hot air over Harvard.
</p>
<p>
That brings me back to Menzel.&nbsp; You emphasize in your article and in
your letter to me that he did not deny the "purported" sightings.&nbsp;
All I've got to say is that's mighty damned nice of him.&nbsp; That was
the alternative to calling the thousands of responsible observers
liars.&nbsp; What the hell else could he do but admit that people have
seen something.&nbsp; Why does <b>that</b> impress you so much?&nbsp; It should
be obvious by now that things unusual have been seen.&nbsp; Did you have
to hear it from him?&nbsp; You don't for 10 seoonds think the Air Force
would still be operating Project Bluebook if they didn't know that
Menzel was full of his own hot air layers, do you?
</p>
<p>
Right here on Miami Beach, On July 29 of 1952, a U.S. Marine
photographer caught 48 frames of a brilliant orange disc on a
starlit night with a sixteen mm. movie camera with telescopic lens.&nbsp;
The army brass grabbed that so fast that only by chance did he
manage to rescue six or eight frames, which I have seen.&nbsp; Sixteen
witnesses watched him take the pictures, and saw the object too.
</p>
<p>

Returning to the word "incredible" which you used to describe the
speed we computed at Norfolk, what do you think the ancient
Egyptians would have thought if a DC6B had flown over their
pyramids? &ndash; or one of the new jet bombers?&nbsp; That would have been
incredible too, eh? &ndash; But we’ve got ’em.
</p>
<p>
Even the Astronomers are beginning to admit that life could exist
on planets belonging to other stars in our own galaxy.&nbsp; If Einstein
is correct, and people do live on these planets, (If Einstein's
Unified Field Theory is correct)
</p>
         <br>

</center>
  <br>
<p class="txt">
then they could get here in much less apparent time to them than it
figures in figures as we use them.&nbsp; Astronomers feel that life would
develop along similar lines, because of the constancy of the
elements in cosmic matter studied with spectroscopes.&nbsp; This checks
well with the many sightings of <b>People</b> near landed saucers.&nbsp;
In no single case, in any part of the World, has anyone attempted
to exaggerate in these descriptions by claiming that they saw
"bubbles" or other breathing devices or space suits, etc. on the
people they saw.&nbsp; In each case, they were breathing our atmosphere.&nbsp;
This happened as recently as June 25 or thereabouts near Oroville,
Cal. when two miners saw a man of small stature jump into the
bottom of a saucer which was resting on a sort of center leg, and
the saucer took off.&nbsp; This was investigated by an Air Force General
in civilian clothes, and is not classified as a hoax.&nbsp; The men have
nothing to gain by a hoax.&nbsp; A friend of mine went to Cal. and lived
with them in another tent for two weeks, and after living with them
and talking to their friends, and the townspeople he is satisfied
that they told the truth.&nbsp; So is the reporter, Basil Benedict, of
the "OROVILLE MURCURY" (sic) who interviewed them.&nbsp; I suggest that
you write to Mr. Benedict to check, if you are really interested.
</p>
<p>
Of course I agree with you that Gerald Heard's bee theories are off
the beam.&nbsp; He based his stuff on the ability of insects to take the
force of the violent turns seen visually and on radar screens (and
I hope you've read Keyhoe's new book, FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER
SPACE).&nbsp;	I do not believe the occupants of these space craft
<b>have</b> to take the centrifugal force.&nbsp; If they have been able
to put the Unified Field Theory to work (The part that describes
gravity as another manifestation of electromagnetism) then the
power which pulls their craft pulls every atom within it's aura
with the same force.&nbsp; Thus there would be no centifugal (sic) force.&nbsp;
In effect, it would be controlling gravity directionally, since
gravity is the only force we know that attracts <b>all</b> materials.&nbsp; The
appearance of these objects lighted in a brilliant electronic
appearing aura, may also give us a clue to theorize upon regarding
how they pass thru our atmosphere at such speeds without heating up
or making a sound.&nbsp; If a powerful static charge were built up and
maintained on the surface of the craft, ionizing the air
immediately around the craft to the extent to create the brilliance
we see, perhaps this air is pushed away from the craft's surface
faster than the craft passes thru it, and since a single charge of
molecules will repel itself, the collapse behind the craft is
relatively slow, preventing the thunder clap a jet makes going thru
the "sound barrier".&nbsp; Pictures I have seen show an alternate
collapse and repulsion (or increase of light) in trails behind some
of the objects.&nbsp; Other photos show a smooth light around the leading
edge of the object, and a rough ragged light trailing from the rear.
</p>
<p>
I do not quite understand your meaning when you say, "Heaven help
us if these things are from outer space."&nbsp;  With that statement, you
too are drawing unfounded conclusions.&nbsp; You assume that there would
be something terribly undesirable about an association with people
(and they are humans very much like us, if my long studies have not
been in vain) from another planet.&nbsp; It seems to me that we could
leran (sic)  much good from them.
</p>
<p>
Logically they cannot be warlike, because they have such science
and are still alive!&nbsp; They haven't destr(o)yed themselves with it as
we seem headed for with our science.&nbsp;  My guess is, heaven help them
if they give us knowledge
</p>
         <br>

  <br>
<p class="txt">
of their science at our present stage of uncivilization.&nbsp; We look
with horror upon the days of the gladiators, yet do the same thing
wholesale.&nbsp; Murder of other humans may be beyond the capability of
understanding of our  visitors.&nbsp; It may be as repulsive to them as
stepping upon a puppy or a kitten and grinding it to death is to us.&nbsp;
I don't think we need fear them.&nbsp; My only fear is that they know us
for the dopes we are, and will leave us again to stumble along
blindly.&nbsp; Remember what happened when we opened Japan to trade and
gave socially undeveloped humans tools of war?&nbsp; For these people to
give us their knowledge now would be like giving atom bombs to the
head-hunters and teaching them how to use them.&nbsp; My thought is
heaven help us if they do not contact us and teach us in some
manner the futility of war.
</p>
<p>
Have you read Charles Fort's three books?&nbsp; He has his tongue in his
cheek in his comments ribbing scientists, but he reports facts.&nbsp; Of
the thousands of facts he reports, I am of the belief that at least
the people, especially where groups are concerned, had an unusual
experience, not readily explainable.
</p>
<p>
I have read no fiction about the discs, but have sought every
available bit of information on the subject and have written
letters to the sighters, met them when I could.&nbsp; I even have your
article in my collection, in spite of how much I disagree with you.&nbsp;
I have found that most cynics have read very little about them.&nbsp; I
was surprised that someone like you, who has been a fan for six
years, would come up with an article like yours.&nbsp; Somewhere though,
I once read the statement, "There is an unbelief which grows out of
ignorance, as well as a skepticism which is born of intelligence",
and I guess that explains it.
</p>
<p>
I still do not feel as tho I am to be classified as a member of
"the esoteric saucer cult", that I have been "agog with excitement
over a nonsensical apparition", that I have been "reduced to the
emotional level of my aboriginal forefathers", that I have
"retrogressed shamefully backward along the path to the dark ages",
or that I have been Contributing to a gullibility that has been "an
especial disgrace of America".&nbsp; (America is the most advanced &ndash; that
should mean that our methods have paid off).&nbsp; You've also called
those of us who are interested enough to search and think and
discuss, "fantasists", and "sensation-seeking saucer sectists".&nbsp; Now,
are you merely showing off your command of English, or do you mean
all that rubble?&nbsp; If you mean it, you can't blame people like myself
and others who are not exactly in any of the above categories for
being irked at such an article.&nbsp; If you didn't mean it you shouldn't
have written it, and you should write an admission in the AIRLINE
PILOT.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, the only reason I can see behind your article is to use
the subject as a vehicle to display your fine command of English.&nbsp;
However, such archaic reporting would be rejected in any paying
magazine or newspaper.&nbsp; For instance, they wont stand for "padding".&nbsp;
You took the first third of the article &ndash; your first four
paragraphs, to say the same thing in different words &ndash; flowery
ones &ndash; that truly, anyone who believes in saucers as space craft is
to be pitied and relegated to the first grade.&nbsp; Again tho, no hard
feelings, &ndash; just hate to see that stuff spread around.

<p class="txt">Captain William B. Nash<br>
400 Ridgewood Road<br>
Miami 49, Florida <br>
</p>
<br>
<p class="txt">Dear Captain Nash:</p>

<p>
Only the pressure of making a living while tending to a diversified
group of pursuits in which I am engaged has kept me from writing
you earlier in reply to your interesting and critical letter of
November 6, 1953.
</p>
<p>
It may interest you to know that you were not my lone critic on the
article, OBITUARY OF THE FLYING SAUCERS, although your criticism
was easily the most harsh I received from any of those many readers
who took umbrage at my endorsement of the Menzel theories.&nbsp;
But you explained that to my satisfaction so there can be no
resentment on my part from your choice of words.&nbsp; However, some of
your criticism, in an effort to be caustic for emphasis, is unfair.
</p>
<p>
Your charge that my choice of the flying saucers for an article,
was made merely to obtain a vehicle to display my fine command of
English is manifestly so ridiculous and in such bad taste that it
hardly should be dignified with a denial, although I do wish to
thank you here for the back-handed compliment.&nbsp; Your indictment of
the three lead paragraphs as "padding" to fill space could not be
farther from the truth because we are constantly beset with the
problem of keeping the column from becoming too ponderous for the
size of the magazine.&nbsp; This requires constant attention, occasional
deletion of pertinent material that I would like to see in the
article, as well as final editing by the editor and president of
the AIR LINE PILOT.&nbsp; It may interest you to know that this
particular article was acclaimed as excellent writing by the
aviation editor of one of New York's biggest newspapers, even
though he did not subscribe to the theories set forth by Dr. Menzel.&nbsp;
I have had an attractive offer from one of the aviation magazines
to transfer my column to it with no restrictions on the number of
words used in each issue.&nbsp; I hardly think it necessary to point out
to you that I receive no fee whatsoever from our ALPA organization
and that this writing, good or bad as you see it, is approached
with humility and only the highest of altruism.&nbsp; Your charge to the
contrary constitutes a travesty against noble purpose.
</p>
<p>
It was culpable of me to refer to Major Keyhoe as editor of
aviation for TRUE; I had not bothered to check on this triviality
but had merely quoted some other writer on the subject of saucers
who had referred mistakenly to him as aviation editor.&nbsp; I mentioned
this grave error to Major Keyhoe this week when I was in
Washington; he laughed heartily at my being taken to task so
severely for it, so I assume that no irreparable damage has been
done, either to his character or to the enviable reputation of TRUE
magazine by my almost inexcusable oversight.
</p>
<p>
I was quoting your first letter to me, verbatim, when I said that
you had claimed that you and Mr. Fortenberry "watched eight 100-ft.
disks cover 50 miles in 12 seconds at 2000 feet above sea level".&nbsp;
Or rather, this was quoted from your rough draft which you had
requested the AIR LINE PILOT to publish in rebuttal.&nbsp; I am
<b>not</b> guilty of the gross  errors you charge me with in
quoting your story from TRUE.&nbsp; Read your quotation over once more.&nbsp;
“Unequivocal" is the only word that fits it; there is no hint of
approximation of size, speed or distance contained in the statement
which you wished to use in the AIR LINE PILOT to answer me.
</p>
<br>
<p class="txt">
<b>Captain William B. Nash, Miami Florida, November 22, 1953 &nbsp; Page 2</b>
</p>
 <br>
  <br>
<p>
In reply to your query about what I have read on the subject of
flying saucers I wish to state once more that no printed word on
the subject has been allowed to go unread once it came to my
attention.&nbsp; I know of no book on the subject which has been
published which I have not rushed right out and bought immediately.&nbsp;
This includes both of the books published in England (are there
more?), IS ANOTHER WORLD WATCHING? and FLYING SAUCERS HAVE LANDED,
both of which I branded as highly speculative and rather fantastic
the moment I finished them.&nbsp; I have also read Charles Fort, and
while I enjoyed his unique brands of sarcasm and cynicism, I did
not rush right out to join the Fortean Society, founded by his many
disciples.
</p>
<p>
The one charge which you made against me to which I have no other
plea than guilty is my unfortunate choice of words in
characterizing true saucer believers as "fantasists" and "saucer
sectists".&nbsp; In fact, it is probable that the entire article was the
most unfortunate story I have ever written.&nbsp; So many people have
pointed out to me so many things wrong with Dr. Menzel's overall
theories that I realize now how right you were when you sought an
excuse for my heresy by including me among those people who want to
disclaim the existence of something both fearful and misunderstood
for the sole purpose of obtaining peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
Six years is a long time to be utterly devoted to a belief, only to
encounter an iconoclast such as Menzel, whose spell I fell under by
reading his mesmeric words only once.&nbsp; My charge that saucer
believers are gullible has backfired right in my face and it is
with a red countenance and tail between my legs that I accept the
haunting recrimination of those I accused and plead guilty to
gullibility myself.&nbsp; It has been weight of incontrovertible evidence
and intelligent discussion with intelligent people (I am happy to
include you) that has reclaimed me to my original religion and all
I can do is ask forgiveness, not only for my back-sliding from
grace, but for my unwarranted ridicule of the faithful.&nbsp; I am truly
sorry and intend to make amends.&nbsp; I am sorry that it cannot be done
immediately.
</p>
<p>
The AIR LINE PILOT is so crowded this month that my regular column
could not be included; for December the entire issue will be
devoted to the Golden Anniversary of Flight and I will once again
be on the sidelines.&nbsp; My column for January is already set in type
and another one which we consider extremely important in the battle
against the damage suits facing us for airplane noise follows in
February.&nbsp; I have another column almost completed for March and it
is on such a timely subject (Tornadoes) that it almost should be
published in early spring.&nbsp; After that my slate is clean and
another column will be done on the saucers.&nbsp;	It will	differ
so much from my book review on Dr. Menzel that I feel sure it will
find more acceptance among our readers than did my ill-advised
earlier attempt.
</p>
<p>
Now that you have my confession and my promise to tell the pilots
that I was as wrong as rain on Easter, I wish to offer a bit of
gratuitous advice to you, a man who really and truly believes he
saw what he thought he saw.&nbsp; It is this: I have noticed that the
majority of people who are privileged to have witnessed a flying
saucer immediately become prey to all kinds of other
cranks — illegitimate, wild-eyed dreamers — such as those poor,
confused folks at Sutton, W.Va. who think they saw a huge, green
monster on a hill where a saucer is supposed to have landed.&nbsp; I
suppose you have been beseiged with all kinds of mail and phone
calls from every crackpot in the country, as well as competent and
qualified observers.&nbsp; It would behoove you to remain somewhat aloof
and to maintain a certain quality of dignified skepticism toward
those reports which seem well, to be charitable — implausible.&nbsp;  I
refer to the likes of George Adamski, who in my opinion, not only
fabricated the most gigantic hoax to date but suborned three other
people to perjury.&nbsp; Winchellizing his name, Adamski is adamskeming
liar, and it is a pity that Desmond Leslie, a true intellectual,
allowed himself to be taken over by this charlatan to the point
where he devastates by his frivolous falsehoods what would have
been by itself a notable volume.&nbsp; It proves you will find thieves
right in your own church.
</p>

Truthfully and remorsefully yours,

211-06 75th. Ave., <br>
Bayside, New York.</p>
<br>

<p class="txt">Dear Captain Hull:</p>
<br>
<p>
Now back from Caracas, I again have time to
answer letters, and am happy to answer yours of November 22nd.
</p>
<p>
First let me reiterate that I am glad that you are again among
those of us who enjoy the study and analysis of the UFOs and that
you will soon publish your amended views in your column.&nbsp; I
have always felt it worthwhile to know someone who has the
fortitude to admit it when he has gotten up a blind alley.&nbsp; Everyone
has a right to an opinion and a right to be wrong but few have guts
enough to say they <b>are</b> wrong.&nbsp; Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
As you well know, my first concern in our communication has been
what is in my opinion the serious loss of faith in the possibility
that saucers are space ships, which was created by your original
article.&nbsp; It seems now that we are in general agreement that the
likelihood of the UFO's being space craft is still a feasible
theory, so the following clarification of trivia resulting from
statements made in our letters is relatively unimportant.&nbsp; However,
since a necessary qualification of a professional pilot is
undeniably the desire to pay attention to detail, here we go.
</p>
<p>
First, perhaps it is true that I was unnecessarily harsh in my
criticism of "padding" in your article.&nbsp; In the light of my small
experience as a writer and the opinions of the editors you
mentioned, I bow to their decisions and apologize.
</p>
<p>
Regarding your reference to your mistaken
identity of Major Keyhoe - you missed the point. Please re-read
the first paragraph on page 2 of my letter to you dated Nov. 6.
My point goes as follows, if put in sequence.
</p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;	You claim you have read all saucer books voraciously
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;	THE FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL by Donald E. Keyhoe is a
saucer book.
</p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp; You finished the book and were still under the mistaken
opinion that Keyhoe was the "Aviation Editor of TRUE"
</p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Keyhoe's book begins as follows:-
</p>
<p class="qut">
&nbsp;"It was a strange assignment.
</p>
<p class="qut">
&nbsp;I picked up the telegram from my desk and read it a third time.
</p>
<br>
<p class="txt" align="center">
<b>to Joe Hull &nbsp;	Pg	&nbsp; 2</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<br>
<p class="qut">
NEW YORK .N.Y, MAY 9, 1949 HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING FLYING SAUCER
MYSTERY. FIRST TIP HINTED GIGANTIC HOAX TO COVER UP OFFICIAL SECRET.&nbsp;
BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN PLANTED TO HIDE REAL ANSWER.&nbsp; LOOKS LIKE
TERRIFIC STORY.&nbsp; CAN YOU TAKE OVER WASHINGTON END?
 <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ken W. Purdy, Editor, TRUE Magazine. ”
</p>
 <br>
<p>
On the same page, Keyhoe writes, "And now an assignment from
TRUE Magazine on flying saucers."
</p>
<p>
On page 50 of THE FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL, There is this paragraph:-
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "When I left the coast, I flew to New York.&nbsp; Ken Purdy called in John DuBarry,  TRUE's Aviation Editor, to hear the details."
</p>
<p>
In other words, the whole book, THE FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL is a
report on what Keyhoe went through to write an article for TRUE on
assignment, so:-
</p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;  It follows that your reading in at least that instance was
inaccurate, and leads me to believe that even though you read much,
you miss a lot.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Hence, your mistake and your absence of knowledge
as to Keyhoe's identity is <b>not</b> a triviality in the light of your reading
claims.
</p>
<p>
Concerning your "unequivocal" charge, it is almost apparent that
you do not even read your own letters very thoroughly.&nbsp; I would like
to refer you to your letter to me dated November 2, 1953, last
paragraph, pg. 1, and the beginning of page 2.&nbsp; In the event that
you do not have the copy of the letter available, here is what you
said:-
</p>
<p>
"I am happy to announce that your article last year in TRUE
Magazine was not one of those which obviously escaped my attention.&nbsp;
I read it with rapt attention and it held me spellbound until the
very last word.&nbsp; But I must confess that it did give rise to a few
questions in my mind which I will take the liberty here of putting
to you.
<p>
<b>As I remember your article</b>, you were cruising southbound,
-etc. etc.-. You state unequivocally that they
were etc. etc."
</p>
<p>
Now the above certainly led me to believe that your charge of
unequivocal referred to the TRUE article, and I think it would lead
any reader to the same conclusion.
</p>

I checked my copy of the article I wrote in answer to yours, and
see that in my haste to get an answer off, I did make it sound
definite as to size and height.&nbsp; It was careless of me, but I am on
record both to the public and to

the Air Technical Intelligence Center in truly conservative
terminology.&nbsp; I have had to repeat the story so often, that I
suppose I am sometimes guilty of abbreviation and it sneaked into
my writing.&nbsp; But it was not in my TRUE presentation, and from
reading your letter I could only gather that you were guilty of
grossly misquoting me.
</p>
<p>

Thank you for your advice about remaining somewhat aloof and
maintaining a quality of dignified skepticism toward reports which
seem "implausible".&nbsp; You are right in your guess that I have received
many contacts from persons regarding the UFO's.
</p>
<p>
Some have claimed that they are "space animals", others have said
that they indicate the second coming of Christ, others that they
have a headquarters on Mount Shasta, California, and are left-overs
from Lemuria.&nbsp; However, I have attempted to maintain a level head
and judge from reports and their sources in a logical fashion.&nbsp; The
word "plausible" in its negative connotation, must be regarded
cautiously in one's dealings with the unknown &ndash; or with any
research, for that matter.&nbsp; The word "implausible" could be again a
general panacea for the unknown, for the neurotics and cynics, and
I want to avoid handcuffing myself by my own sudden opinions.&nbsp; Some
of my original opinions about the saucers have changed radically,
and the judgements I hold at present are not hidebound.&nbsp; They are,
however, based on looking at everything in the light of its being
possible first, <b>then</b> eliminating it if it does not stand up
under the record we have to judge by.&nbsp; I have even received photos
which were deceptions, such as the birthday cake candle flames, but
try to subject all such material to true tests.&nbsp; I do not wish to
remain so aloof that I miss something important &ndash; an item which
might be the key to the mystery.
</p>
<p>
From your letters to me, I can see that you permit yourself to make
decisions too suddenly &ndash; or at least too definitely, such as Adamski
being adamskeming liar, which you do not know.&nbsp; However you did say
a sentence earlier that it was "in your opinion" that he is a liar.&nbsp;
In an earlier letter to me you said unequivocally, that Frank
Scully is a "lousy, reprehensible fraud."&nbsp; Actually you don't
<b>know</b> this either.&nbsp; He might have been taken in by a fraud &ndash;
or there might be a basic truth to the story itself in spite of
TRUE’s article revealing their dubious <b>characters</b>.&nbsp; (GeBauer,
Scully and Newton). Actually there might be a great deal more to the
little man stories than at first meets the eye, because of
"implausibility".
</p>
<p>
I think it will behoove us more and more to investigate very
completely before committing ourselves.&nbsp;  Very soon it will be
revealed that many of our physical "laws" will have to be
completely revised, and it was recently found by astronomers, to
their chagrin, that they've been wrong by 100% on their
measurements of the Universe and the size of galaxies.

<p class="txt">Dear Bill:</p>
<p>
I guess we have corresponded back and forth long enough that I may
take the liberty of addressing you by your first name; at least it
seems as though I should know you by now.&nbsp; And please call me Joe
(my first name's William, too, but it never took like the second)
in any future correspondence&nbsp;. Since we have such common interests
we should at least be as intimate as golfing partners.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you know by now the Civilian Saucer Intelligence had its
first public meeting in New York last week and the featured speaker
for the evening was one George Adamski from Mt. Palomar, California.&nbsp;
You and I have discussed him by mail in the past and I was very
pleased to note by your last letter that you had come around to my
original appraisal of the man (formed at the time I read his
outrageous insult to the literary world, "FLYING SAUCERS HAVE
LANDED").&nbsp; You formed the opinion of me that I make up my mind in a
hurry about something; perhaps too early, according to you, but
I'll tell you this, Bill, I was blessed from birth with that
especial type of analytical mind which allows me to spot a quisling
or a fraud in a moment and I'll base my reputation of the past,
present and the future on the unequivocal analysis I made of this
guy Adamski at the very outset:&nbsp; He is an out and out fraud, the
glibbest charlatan it has ever been my privilege and disgust to
meet.&nbsp; His "lecture" the other night consisted of 45 minutes of
pseudo-scientific double talk, any phase of which could have been
pulled apart instantaneously by even an average student of science.
</p>
<p>
When I heard he was to be the speaker I spent five hours reviewing
his portion of the book in which he collaborated with Desmon Leslie,
a man of whom I formed the opinion of high intellect but amazing
ingenuousness, and I composed 25 questions for him to answer.&nbsp; I
made eight carbon copies of this questionaire and distributed them
to some of the skeptics who had expressed a desire to "trip"
Adamski up.&nbsp; We all but turned the meeting into a rout after he
finished speaking and began a question-and-answer session.&nbsp; He was
saved from the embarrassment of a complete debacle by the
sympathetic intervention of one "Doctor" McDonald, the master of
ceremonies, whose everyday occupation is — of all things! — a
spirit medium.&nbsp; McDonald steered the questioning away from our
little clique — John DuBarry was in it — and I suppose he did this
because he thought it might hurt his business.&nbsp; Of the 400-odd
people present, I was told many of the elderly distaff listeners
were regular seance customers of his.&nbsp; This may or may not be true
but I do know that if he had not guided the questioning away from
our corner we would have made a monkey of Adamski.&nbsp; As it was, he
was apologetic but very glad to seize upon the excuse that he had
to "catch a train", the destination of which he did not divulge.
</p>
<br>
<center> <b>- 2 -</b></center>
<br>
<p>
I want to be on record with you that I spotted this moral leper
from nothing more than his written words, the likes of which these
busy and omnivorous eyes have never before fallen upon.&nbsp; He
convinced almost nobody, except, possibly, some of "Doctor"
McDonald's sycophants and neurotic old dowagers.&nbsp; Elliott Rockmore,
president of C.S.I., remains adamant in his earlier appraisal of
Adamski.&nbsp; He told several members after the meeting he is more
convinced than ever the guy has made up a monstrous lie and is
trying to cash in on it.&nbsp; Do you know Rockmore?&nbsp; Although I have
never seen his collection, it is reputed to be the biggest file of
flying saucer reports in the world.&nbsp; One guy who claims to know told
me the Pentagon did not even have as much stuff.&nbsp; He even has
photostatic copies of 1870 newspaper reports of strange UFO’s.&nbsp;
I expect to see his collection soon.
</p>
<p>
After the meeting was over, one prominent member and I deplored the
fact that no coverage by the press had been arranged, although the
meeting had been mentioned by at least one columnist.&nbsp; So, after it
was over and we had a few days to discuss the aspects of it, I
wrote to a staff writer on the World-Telegram & Sun to see what
their reactions would be to the suggestion that they start a little
sleuth job on Adamski (such as J. P. Cahn employed with such marked
success that he aided in sending Silas Newton and Geo. GeBauer to
the penitentiary).&nbsp; The World-Telegram is the one New York newspaper
which has never adopted a pooh-pooh attitude toward the saucers and
we thought they would give the case a little thought.&nbsp; They have it
under advisement at the moment but so far have made no move.&nbsp; It
will surprise me mightily if J. P. Cahn is not already hard at work
on Adamski.&nbsp; It is a natural story for him.
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of laughs with a C.S.I. member named Jack Smith from
Jackson Heights tonight.&nbsp; He was talking about you and how you had
been corresponding with "some pilot in New York who does not
believe in the saucers and even tried to trick me with same
under-exposed pictures of a birthday cake".&nbsp; I told Smith the whole
story, that <b>I do believe</b> in the existence of flying saucers,
that my few weeks of alienation of affection from the cause was
occasioned by the mesmeric words of Dr. Menzel; that since then,
<b>and mainly through your logic</b>, I had renounced him and his
theories; but I denied trying to "trick” you with my 35 mm shots,
in the sense that they were submitted to you as a test of your
gullibility to see how you would measure up in my league.&nbsp; It is
painful to report that some PAA pilots refer to you as "that
crackpot" and I wanted to see just how you would react to some
foolish shots that have fooled other people who have viewed them.&nbsp;
That you passed the test with flying colors I have left no doubt in
the minds of people with whom I have conversed about you since.&nbsp;
(What a hell of a sentence that just was!&nbsp; Never get by an editor's
blue pencil).&nbsp; It may interest you to know that you are the only
person who has ever come close to guessing what the 37 lights are.&nbsp;
(Adamski reports the saucers travel in squadrons of 32, you know).
</p>
<p>
 I get a bang out of telling the story around the airline.&nbsp; So did
Smith tonight.&nbsp; We laughed and laughed.
 </p>
<p>
I don’t believe I ever got around to writing you about the
challenge I offered Doctor Menzel for a television debate, all the
time and details arranged for by myself and station WDSU-TV in New
Orleans, last February?&nbsp; I was flying New York to New Orleans (I
always fly south in the winter; bless this seniority) and I
happened to learn that he was going to address some group at Tulane
University on the subject of flying saucers.&nbsp; Feeling that, at long
last, an opportunity had presented itself for me to redeem part of
my short-sightedness  in characterizing serious, reliable, mature
colleagues of my profession as "fantasists" and "esoteric saucer
cultists" for believing in the saucers, I offered to debate the
subject with Dr. Menzel on TV.&nbsp; But Hubie Weiss, program director of
WDSU-TV was unable to get Menzel for the only date that our
schedules coincided, although he was in New Orleans and appeared as
a guest on another TV show on the same station the day before.
</p>
<br>
<center> <b>- 3 -</b></center>
<br>
<p class="txt">
It may be that the subject of fee was the
stumbling block which actually came between us.&nbsp; I offered to appear
with no fee, defending the unofficial view of many airline pilots
whom I had offended by an article I had done in my column in the
AIR LINE PILOT about a year ago.&nbsp; As you know, saucer authorities,
such as Adamski, Keyhoe, Menzel, Samford and Gloria Swanson must
get pretty good fees on television these days because their
services are much in demand.&nbsp; Anyway, it did not appeal to the
eminent astrophysicist because he made no overtures toward
acceptance of my challenge.&nbsp; But, as I explained to Hubie Weiss and
Tom Hicks of WDSU-TV, it was probably just as well, because some of
the questions I had ready for Dr. Menzel could hardly have been
answered by the standard "cobweb" or "mirage" hodge-podge on which
he depends.&nbsp; I am confident that history will prove Menzel a
scientific ostrich and a regret which I shall take to the grave is
my inability to meet the man, face to face, and atone, at least in
part, for the injustice I dealt many of my honest, sincere
colleagues when I momentarily deserted them to listen to the
heresies of Menzel and to endorse his book.&nbsp; Today his book reads
like the foolishness it is but when I first read it and reported it
to my readers it fulfilled the craving in my heart that only the
common sense and indisputable evidence of men such as you dispelled.&nbsp;
My plea?&nbsp; Insanity.
</p>
<p>
Jack smith told me you had run into a big barrage of denial from
the Air Force about some assertions you made at a Miami
aeronautical meeting recently, in which you contended the Air Force
had some hardware from flying saucers which they have not admitted.&nbsp;
Your last letter to me states the same thing.&nbsp; Are you sure, or can
it be that an over-enthusiastic member of the "cult" is allowing
himself to make statements in public which can only come back to
haunt him?&nbsp; I have never heard anyone else claim the Air Force had
any hardware; you are the first.&nbsp; Where did you get this information?&nbsp;
Harking back to an old letter of mine, I'm sure you will find the
admonishment not to listen to all these saucer enthusiasts who are
sure to beset you because of your published opinions.&nbsp; You must use
the spirit of a sound mind, as the Scriptures admonish each of us.&nbsp;
It is hard to believe in something so foreign in nature to anything
in acceptance on earth today without allowing one's self to go
overboard with reports from some of the charlatans and headline
hunters that are natural fellow travelers.&nbsp; But I’m sure by now you
hardly need advice from one who claims never to have seen a flying
saucer, although he has been a startled witness to two completely
unorthodox displays of an uncertain firmament in recent
years....Yet, I caution you, do as the C.S.I. does in New York:&nbsp;
Accept nothing at face value.&nbsp; Prove it.&nbsp; Then prove it again.&nbsp; After
mixing with other saucer devotees and swapping tales of sightings
it is difficult not to arrive at the mental frame of mind in which
the ATIC in the Pentagon works: Everything is a fake until proven
otherwise.&nbsp; You should see the pictures a photographer made of a
flying saucer over Passaic, N.J. last month. What fakes! ...
</p>
<p>
The next meeting of C.S.I. is slated for April 23rd in Steinway
Hall, 115 W. 57th, and if you have any chance at all of being in
Miami for a few days, including this date, we would be happy to
have you as our guest.&nbsp; A Mr. Ivan T. Sanderson, of whom
I know little, is going to present a tape recording of the
investigations of the "Sutton Monster".&nbsp; The subject is not new to
any Capital Airlines pilot who has ever flown West Virginia.&nbsp; From
May until November they see "Sutton Monsters" — the tallest
cumulo-nimbus formations on our entire system.&nbsp; But this one Mr.
Sanderson will discuss is 10 feet tall, with a red face and a
green body (discounted by Keyhoe in his last book) and of course,
we are looking forward to the meeting with the freshman enthusiasm
which characterizes the saucer addict's devotion to his  first love.&nbsp;
Hope you can make it.

211-06 75th. Ave., <br>
Bayside, New York.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="txt">Dear Joe:</p>

<p>I enjoyed your letter of the 17th, and was pleased to hear from you again.&nbsp; Jack
Smith had written to me, and mentioned your meeting.&nbsp; I'd like to know more about
the Civilian Saucer Intelligence organization.&nbsp; What is the address of
headquarters and do they publish information?&nbsp; Unfortunately, I shall be in
ground school on part of a six months check on April 23rd &ndash; but would appreciate
hearing your opinion of Ivan Sanderson and his tape recordings on the Sutton
case.</p>

<p>Before I go into anything else, I'll cover that AP item from the Air Force
regarding my statement about "hardware".
</p>

<p>Norman Bean, an electronic engineer, and Technical Director for WTVJ, one of our
local TV stations, gives lectures on the saucer subject on the average of 3
times per week, and has done so for two years.&nbsp; He is greatly in demand, and does
a good job gratis.&nbsp;  He had a lecture scheduled for the Greater Miami Aviation
Association, a group of intelligent business men who further Miami's Aviation in
every way possible.&nbsp; Norman called me the day before the lecture and asked me to
substitute for him.&nbsp; Having never given a lecture in my life, I hesitated, but he
insisted that I could do it, so I agreed to try.
</p>
<p>
The meeting was a luncheon at the 7-Seas restaurant in Miami.&nbsp; The lecture was a
30 minute affair during which I mentioned no "hardware" in possession of the Air
Force.&nbsp; Then I left it open for questions, (there were only about 25 men there)
One of the questions was, "Why, in your opinion, is the Air Force withholding
information from the public?"&nbsp; I gave an answer which I believe, and which I
wrote about in a newspaper article a long time ago.
</p>
<p>
I said that the Air Force has openly told Newsmen that they fear a panic if they
tell the truth about the saucers.&nbsp; I also said that I do not believe that this is
the true reason, The Air Force <b>must</b> be intelligent enough to realize the
tremendous weapon they are putting into the hands of an enemy nation by
withholding the truth.&nbsp; If the enemy hit us tomorrow with everything they had,
and simultaneously
</p>
         <br>
<center>
<strong>2.</strong>
</center>
  <br>
 <p class="txt">
dropped leaflets and broadcast on all possible radio frequencies that
 the flying saucers were their own weapons and that they were about to eliminate us with them, then Our Air Force <b>Would</b> have a panic on their hands.
</p>
<p>
Since our Air Force must be intelligent enough to recognize this danger, they
therefore must have such an important reason for not admitting that saucers are
interplanetary, that they are willing to risk the Public's safety to protect the
secret.</p>

<p>What could such a secret be?&nbsp; I said this:- That, <b>in my opinion</b>, by the
above deductions, there must be some vestige of truth in the oft repeated rumor
that the Air Force has a saucer or parts thereof in their possession;&nbsp; that they
feared that if they admitted that they thought saucers were interplanetary that
they would be pressed for the evidence and did not want to <b>have</b> to
produce their prize and any resulting new discoveries in order to prevent this
information from falling into the hands of the enemy.&nbsp; Thus far the Russians have
stolen anything they so desired.&nbsp; What better way to prevent the loss of
information that (sic) to deny the whole business and poo-poo it away to prevent
espionage.</p>

<p>The above was my answer to one question at the end of the lecture, and heaven
only knows how it got so spread around or why, exactly one month later, the Air
Force took the trouble to issue an official denial.&nbsp; My little old answer to a
man's question <b>couldn't</b> have gotton (sic) to many people, but the AF
certainly brought it before millions of people!&nbsp; If they are actually trying to
keep saucers out of the news, that's a dumb way to go about it.&nbsp; Also, if my
opinion in the answer above <b>is</b> true, and <b>I</b> can figure it out, then
so can an enemy espionage agent, so I felt no qualms about voicing my personal
opinion.&nbsp; If true, it would already be out of the bag to anyone interested.&nbsp; If
ours there is the alternative &ndash; that the AF <b>is</b> stupid enough to hand
such a propaganda weapon to an enemy &ndash; but I hope not!</p>

<p>Note that my answer was based on personal opinion by deductive reasoning, and
nothing else.&nbsp; However there are many things which make me believe that it is
true that the AF has something at Wright Field.&nbsp; I'll tell you a few &ndash; but I'd
appreciate it if you kept the information confidential for a number of reasons,
not the least of which is the fact that PAA Publicity Department here in Miami
has asked that I keep PAA's name out of the Saucer business.&nbsp; This stems from one
man, and I'm going to work on him at the first opportunity.&nbsp; He needs a saucer
education.&nbsp; But I cannot blame him at the moment.&nbsp; Press people call him as head of Public Relations, on the Saucer stuff.&nbsp; He can't give an answer and the press
thinks he's holding out.&nbsp; He must stay in good with the press, sooooooo, that's
it.</p>

<p>First of all, when Bill Fortenberry and I were interviewed by the AF
interrogators the morning after the sighting, they put us in separate rooms.&nbsp;
Before the interview, we had agreed to ask the men if there was any truth behind
the</p>
<br>
<center>
<strong>
   3.
</strong>
</center>
<br>
<p class="txt">rumor that the AF had one or more saucers at Wright Field.&nbsp;
Bill remembered to ask, in his room.&nbsp; One of the investigators told him,
"Yes, it <b>is</b> true."</p>

<p>I had forgotten to ask.&nbsp; However, when all of the investigators and Bill and I
were in one room, I remembered and did ask the question.&nbsp; A Major Sharp was the
only interrogator in uniform.&nbsp; They all opened their mouths to answer the
question, and quickly, Major Sharp looked at <b>them</b>, not me, and said very
quickly, "NO!"&nbsp; It appeared that he was telling them to shut up rather than
addressing the answer to me.
</p>
<p>
In New York, when I was taking the Interplanetary side against three
non-believers on a WJZ half hour TV panel discussion, (my opponents were Professor
Lloyd Motz, Dr. of Astronomy, Barnard College, Professor Richard Youte, Dr. of
Psychology, Columbia University and Mr. Frank Foster, Chief Meteorologist,
Hayden Planetarium), I was thirsty (probably from nervousness) before the
program, and stepped out of the studio to find a fountain.&nbsp; A man who had been
peering thru the glass door stopped me and asked what I thought of the Saucers.&nbsp;
I replied immediately that I thought they were interplanetary.&nbsp; He said "You're
right!"&nbsp; &ndash; not, I <b>think</b> you're right or any other qualifying
statement.&nbsp; I  asked him about a fountain and he walked with me directing me on
a complicated route to the nearest fountain, so obviously he knew the studios.&nbsp;
From his voice,  he might have been a commentator.&nbsp; He would not identify himself,
but said he had just returned from Washington, and had been given the whole story.&nbsp;
(this was  the beginning of Aug/52)&nbsp; He said that the "Wright Field Story" was
true, and that the AF had recently operated a radio found in a saucer and caused the
flurry of sightings over Washington where it was operated.&nbsp; He said he couldn't
tell me more, because he, and a LIFE reporter and another reporter who had been
with them had been given the story on the basis that they'd release it only when
notified.&nbsp; Evidently they were never notified.&nbsp; Robert S. Allen writes me that
he's never been able to get at the report again that he was allowed to read,
which the AF was, (sic) about the fall of 52, going to release to the public.
</p>
<p>
An Air Force Major told Norman Bean that it was true that there was a saucer at
Wright Field, but that if Norman quoted him, he'd deny it.
</p>
<p>
Several reports came to Norman quite innocently about GI’s who saw the thing on
a flat-car, but this is a vague one.
</p>
<p>
Here's a beauty.&nbsp; A wealthy friend of mine in Miami has a salesman whose wife,
once a WAC worked under Intelligence at Wright Patterson Field as a radio operator and decoder
of <b>all</b> information.&nbsp; I heard her tell this story in a straightforward manner,
which I find  difficult to doubt.&nbsp; In the fall of 1952, she received a signal for
 a red and white alert, which you probably know is an AIRCRAFT ATTACK warning alert.&nbsp;
 They were on this alert for two weeks.&nbsp; At the end of the two weeks she found out
 that they had called the alert because
</p>
<br>
<center>
<strong>
  4.
  </strong>
</center>
<br>
<p class="txt">
a flying saucer had been found after landing (she believes near Columbus, the
biggest supply depot), and the thing had been brought to Wright Field.&nbsp; They had
called the alert because, from what they found in the Saucer (she didn't know
what) they thought it had relayed valuable information back to an enemy and an
attack was coming up.&nbsp;  Everone (sic) was excited about it there, and she talked
to the photographers (Army Photog.) who went in to photograph it, and she saw
one picture which a photographer named Joe brought to her.&nbsp; It was taken from an
angle, she said, "As tho you stood on a chair and took a forward downward view
of it"&nbsp;  She said it had no wings, was round, silvery, but couldn't guess its
size except to say that,&nbsp; "It didn't look to (sic) big, but I had nothing to
compare it with."
</p>

<p>This girl has a child, and a fine home, and has cancer so badly that she isn't
expected to live more than a year.&nbsp; I don’t think she is lying.</p>

<p>Then, of course, is the mysterious case of the man who claimed to have seen a
saucer in <strike>New</strike> Mexico, near Mexico City, which had fallen.&nbsp; He changed his
whole story later and said he was just joking &mdash; He was not noted as that kind
of a person.</p>

<p>Then there is the Maury Island Mystery.&nbsp; Read Ken Arnold's, THE COMING OF THE
SAUCERS.&nbsp; Clinkers were said to have dropped from a saucer in plain view of men,
and the AF took them away.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the AF <b>does</b> have something, but I have not been
going about spreading this theory; I merely answered a man's question at a small
lecture to a small group of men.&nbsp; However, there must have been a newsman there.&nbsp;
There was a visitor &ndash; a 4 striper Coast Guard &ndash; local boss.&nbsp; All I can
guess is that I hit the Air Force in a very soft spot to get such a rise out of them!&nbsp;
My Wife  and Father-in-Law were in the audience at the lecture, and are as surprised as I
am that such a fuss resulted.</p>

<p>Well &ndash; enough of that.&nbsp; I just Read the TRUE article written by Ruppelt.&nbsp; Ye
God's!&nbsp; Another insult to the intelligence of anyone who has been following the
subject closely.&nbsp;  Admittedly, it will fool the hell out of the average man, but
it is a very intelligent attempt at deception, designed to fool even the average
saucer fan &ndash; in fact, it is <b>aimed</b> at them &ndash; or should i
say &ndash; "us".&nbsp; He's a shrewd one.&nbsp; He gives enough unsolved stuff to
make one believe he is being honest, but he distorts other cases in the typical A.F.
fashion.&nbsp; He bungled the  hell out of his attempt with the Washington Radar
sightings; &ndash; I'll bet that he'd have avoided that one if he thought he could.&nbsp;
Also he distorted Desvergers' story tremendously.&nbsp; I happen to have in my collection
clippings which make Ruppelt a liar.&nbsp; He said that Desvergers told the papers the
AF wouldn't let him  talk.&nbsp; That's a lie.&nbsp; I have clippings which
 say,&nbsp; "The scoutmaster, D.S. "Sonny" Desvergers, a hardware salesman, conceded
 he was free, as far as military  authorities are concerned, to tell all about his
 experiences the night of Aug.  9" &ndash; unquote.&nbsp; Also Ruppelt glossed over
 the testimony of the three Boy Scouts who were with</p>

<p class="txt">Desvergers.&nbsp; The boys have excellent reputations in the City, and ieven(sic) if they didn't, it is next to impossible to get two boys, 11 years old and one, 12
years old to lie consistently under separate interrogation.&nbsp; In my clippings of
the time of the incident are these statements from reporters' interviews of the
boys.</p>

<p>"They had gone a half mile again, when 2 of the boys, looking back, saw lights
again.&nbsp; Young Stevens said he saw several white lights in an eliptical (sic)
pattern, "which went out and reappeared as red lights".&nbsp; Young Ruffing described
what he saw as "white lights in a straight line eight feet off the ground."</p>

<p>After Desvergers went into the area of the lights young Ruffing gives this
description of what followed.</p>

<p>"I could see about the top half of his (Desvergers) body.&nbsp; (That is all he'd be
able to see, due to palmettos.&nbsp; I was on the spot with Desvergers two weeks ago)&nbsp;
Then the beam of his flashlight pointed up and reflected back on him like it had
shined on a mirror.&nbsp; Then a reddish white ball of fire like a Roman candle came
down toward him from the sky.&nbsp; Then he fell down and disappeared."</p>

<p>Young Bowen said he saw "bright red lights like railroad flares".</p>

<p>Desvergers told me that after several straight days of solid questioning,
physical exams and checking pieces of skin from his arm, he told them that he
was just a Florida cracker &ndash; not accustomed to all of this high pressure stuff,
and he was losing money by not working, and that he was going home.&nbsp; To renew
interviews, the officers brought him a bunch of their records of sightings.&nbsp; (He
told me he's convinced the AF doesn't have any hardware &ndash; feels he'd have seen
it in these records if they did)&nbsp; He said they asked him to make comparisons with
his experience, and were pretty nice to him from then on.&nbsp; He said they stopped
the high pressure stuff after he rebelled.</p>

<p>At present, Desvergers seems to be a successful, intelligent citizen.&nbsp; He has his
own business selling and installing glass showers, owns a home, a 1953 Murcury
(sic) station wagon and a hydroplane racing boat.&nbsp; He tells his story in front of
his wife with sincerity.&nbsp; He said the men on the saucer looked like us with one
exception, which he will not reveal.&nbsp; Also said he was asked not to reveal
something he saw around the egdes (sic) of the saucer.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes me feel that Desvergers had his experience, in spite of
his past reputation, is the "smell" business.&nbsp; He was the <b>first</b> person to
report the awful odor accompanying some of the saucers.&nbsp; It was reported in the
"Monster" Case in West Va., around Sept 15, and at Belle Glade, Fla. on Sept
16th., both cases after Desverger's experience.&nbsp; Then, two years later, Leslie,
in the book with Adamski, quoted an ancient Egyptian Sighting taken from old
writings in the Vatican Library, in which, a "Foul odor" was described coming
from fiery discs &ndash; or Fire Circles" as they called them.&nbsp; What would inspire
Desvergers to fabricate anything like a "smell like burning flesh or rotton
(sic) eggs" right out of thin air if were originating his story?</p>

<p>Also there was another saucer, or UFO, seen at West Palm Beach on Sept 5, 1952.&nbsp;
It was observed by Miss June Zent, a 15 yr. old High school student and Mr And
Mrs Wendell Wells, her Uncle and Aunt.&nbsp;  Mr Wells first saw the object.
</p>

<p>"It was in front of us way up in the sky.&nbsp; At first it looked like one big
yellow-white light.&nbsp; It seemed to be drifting-slanting down.&nbsp; Then it got over
into the woods on the left side of the road and dropped straight down.&nbsp; When it
got down closer to the ground it looked like it had more lights.&nbsp; And right after
it landed we saw another light that seemed to hover over the spot."&nbsp; The light
didn't resemble that of an airplane but reminded them of the rim of a coin.</p>

<p>  "We turned down military trail to get closer to the place where it landed.&nbsp;
  Soon we could see where the bushes were all lit up.&nbsp; There are no houses
  around, so it is evident that's where it landed"</p>

<p>
The landing place appeared to be a block and a half East of military trail&nbsp; (The
same road that Desvergers was on during his experience).&nbsp; They couldn't drive
back and didn'(t) want to go on foot because of the Wells' small children who
were in the car.&nbsp; Only comment from the Air Force was, "We're investigating".</p>

<p>Mis(s) Zent's address is 512&frac12; Georga Ave, West Palm Beach Fla, and the Wells
are residents of Belle Glade.</p>

<p>It looks pretty obvious that the UFO's were interested in something in that
general area and that Desvergers was telling the truth.&nbsp; Why didn't Ruppelt
mention Miss Zent's and the Wells' sighting?&nbsp; If I were Desvergers, I'd look up
Ruppelt and punch him in the nose.</p>

<p>The farmer, Fred Brown, at Belle Glade, who had a saucer drift across his
pasture at 30mph twice, each time stampeding his cows to t(h)e other end of the
pasture, having horses break a fence and a gate, and who smelled the strong odor
when the saucer went over, couldn't very well be copying the "smell" from
Desvergers, because I talked to men who work with Brown, who came to work
several hours after the experience, smelled the lingering odor and asked Brown
what the hell he'd been spraying with.&nbsp; Also the only reason Brown told anybody
at all was because he had to short the milk customers (the cows had to be forced
back to the barn &ndash; then gave only 5 gallons of milk instead of 15 for the next 3
days and didn't return to normal output for 3 weeks) and they wanted to know
why.&nbsp; Brown has a good rep.&nbsp; I talked to him a long time personally.&nbsp;
He was with Gen. Patton for 4 years and 8 months in the Army.&nbsp; The Army and Navy both questioned him at the Farm the next day.&nbsp; When he tried to ask them questions
they told him they were there to ask &ndash; not answer.&nbsp; Incidently, it took all day to catch the horses and get them back to the pastu(r)e.&nbsp; None of the animals
wanted to return to that place.</p>

<p class="txt">down toward them.&nbsp; He pulled to one side calling to the others.&nbsp;Suddenly the thing stopped two or 3 thousand feet above them, (they were at 22,000 ft.)&nbsp; He could see clearly, a gleaming spherical ball of white about twice as big as his jet, with a gold ring around the lower third, like Saturn except the ring was off-center.&nbsp;
It hovered as he tried to get the others to see it.&nbsp; They didn't, and it
suddenly accelerated to the East and disappeared in 15 seconds.&nbsp; He had been a
saucer skeptic, but he said over the phone that now, "I am damned convinced"</p>

<p>Holland was a War II pilot and won six battle stars and 2 distinguished flying
service crosses in Korea.&nbsp; Five civilians also reported the object.&nbsp; I wonder what they'll call this one?&nbsp;  Perhaps a lost Easter Egg?</p>

<p>There have been a number of sightings here recently by the Ground Observer
Corps, and by persons in boats at night.&nbsp; Either Ruppelt is so accustomed to
deception that he can't get it out of his system &ndash; or he is still in cahoots
with the ATIC and their patronizing attitude toward the public, in which I feel
that they take the liberty of deifying themselves.&nbsp; True, there are crackpots &ndash;
but when the reports are sifted, an awful lot are <b>not</b> from crackpots.
</p>

<p>As far as "being taken in" by frauds and deceivers, I still want to emphasize
to you, Joe, that because I write to these people does not mean that I swallow
every tale whole.&nbsp; As I said in a letter to you before, My opinion as to the way
to get the most out of this subject and avoid missing somthing (sic) that might
be important, is to check everything that comes to your attention.&nbsp; I believe
that this is one subject in which it is profitable in gaining knowledge, to
operate on the assumption that everything is possible until proved otherwise by
investigation.&nbsp; (I do not recommend broadcasting it that way though) I definitely
do not agree with the principle "Everything is a fake until proved otherwise"&nbsp;
That's a good way to miss something valuable.&nbsp; In this UFO investigation no one
can possibly be an "Expert", nor can reports be judged on comparison with things
plausible as we know them.&nbsp; A new and willing attitude, unchained by past
experience comparisons is a valuable asset;&nbsp; all this without becoming gullible.</p>

<p>I notice again, that the AF made no mention of the best Movies ever taken of a
Saucer, the photography and object witnessed by sixteen persons.&nbsp; <a href="../../fig/1952mayher.htm">That is Ralph Mayher's Film taken in Fall of '52</a> at Miami Beach.&nbsp; He was in Marines at the time.&nbsp;
Got out a few months ago and now the story will appear in June "PIC" out May
5th.&nbsp; Ralph now lives at 3472 W. 136th St., Cleveland Ohio.&nbsp; Why don't you look
him up?&nbsp; Wonder why brother Ruppelt left this one out when he was talking about
movies?&nbsp; The AF has his film&nbsp; (Lt. White at Pentagon recently told him he could
have it back)</p>

<p>Wish you could have gotten the TV deal with Menzell!&nbsp;  And
that you could have continued questioning Adamski.&nbsp; Nice
try in both cases!&nbsp; You might let Jack Smith read this.</p>

<br>
<p class="int">
Three years after engaging William Nash in a spirited debate about the
possible existence of "Unidentified Flying Objects", Captain Joe Hull
experienced his own extraordinary "UFO" sighting which once and
for all removed all doubt from his mind about the reality of the
phenomenon.
</p>
<p class="int1">
On the night of November 14, 1956, Captain Joe Hull and his co-pilot,
Peter Macintosh, were in control of Capital Airlines Flight 77, a Viscount
passenger flight from New York to Mobile, Alabama.&nbsp; At approximately 10:10 p.m.
while some 60 miles from Mobile, Hull and Macintosh witnessed what they
thought was a brilliant meteor flash by their aircraft.&nbsp; However,
unlike a meteor, this light stopped, hovered and for several minutes displayed
a range of aerobatics that no earthly aircraft was capable of.
</p>
<p class="int1">
Hull sent a full report of his encounter to John DuBarry, the
aviation editor for TRUE magazine, and also president of Civilian
Saucer Investigation (CSI) NY.&nbsp; The report was later reprinted
in the "CSI Confidential Bulletin" magazine of July, 1957.
</p>
<p class="int1">
Captain Hull was killed on April 6, 1958, when another
Capital Airlines Viscount he was piloting crashed and burned, with
no survivors, in Freeland, Michigan.&nbsp; The cause of the crash
was determined to be undetected icing of the horizontal stabilizers
during the landing approach.

<p class="intc">
(The sighting which follows is of particular interest because it was
made by an expert observer — a veteran airline pilot — who was
formerly extremely skeptical on the subject of flying saucers.&nbsp; In
fact, in 1953 Captain Hull wrote an article for Airline Pilot
magazine titled <a href="../../fig/1953a.htm#hull">"The Obituary of the Flying Saucers"</a>.
&nbsp;We reprint, with his permission, a slightly condensed excerpt from the letter
to CSI President John DuBarry in which he described his experience.)
</p>
<br>
<p class="int1">On the night of November 14, 1956 I was flying a Viscount at high
altitude from New York to Mobile, Alabama.&nbsp; We were above a layer of
clouds which were occasionally broken, giving us a glimpse of the
ground now and then.&nbsp; At 10:10 p.m. E.S.T., when only about 60 miles
from Mobile, my co-pilot Peter Macintosh and I saw what we thought
was a brilliant meteor.&nbsp; We were flying south-southwest and it fell
across our path from left to right, first becoming visible at the
top of the windshield.&nbsp; (The Viscount has wonderful visibility
upward.) It decelerated rapidly, just as any meteor does when
entering the denser layers of the earth's lower atmosphere, and we
expected to see it burn out with the customary flash, which pilots
often see, but which people on the ground are often denied.

<center><span class="tab">A Capital Airlines Viscount</span></center>
<br>


<p class="int1">
Imagine our consternation when this brilliant light did not burn
out, but abruptly halted directly in front of us.&nbsp; It was an intense
blue-white light, approximately 7 or 6 times as bright as Venus
when this planet is at its brightest magnitude. Pete shouted "What
the hell is it, a jet?"&nbsp; His first thought, of course, was that the
object was a diving jet fighter which had turned sharply away from
us and in departing, was giving us a view right up its glowing
tailpipe.&nbsp; Instantly I knew this could not possibly be an airplane.
I have seen the glow of too many jet pipes at night not to
recognize one when I see it.&nbsp; It was not the right color; it did not
diminish in size, as a departing jet fighter's exhaust should have;&nbsp;
and it remained motionless directly ahead of us, how far I cannot
say, but it must have been quite a few miles.
</p>
<p class="int1">
I quickly grabbed my microphone and called the Mobile Control Tower.&nbsp;
"Bates Tower, this is Capital 77.&nbsp; Look out toward the north and
east and see if you can see a strange white light hovering in the
sky."
</p>
<p class="int1">
"Capital 77, this is Mobile Bates Tower.&nbsp; We are unable to see much
of the sky because of a thick cloud cover.&nbsp; Do you think the object
is in our vicinity?"
</p>
<p class="int1">
"Affirmative.&nbsp; It looks like a brilliant white light bulb, about one
tenth the size of the moon.&nbsp; It is directly ahead of us and at about
our altitude, or slightly higher.&nbsp; We are right over Jackson,
Alabama and have descended to 10,000 feet.&nbsp; Please initiate a call
to Brookley Field Tower (Air Force Field 20 miles southeast of
Bates Field) and ask the controller if he can see it on their big
radar scope."&nbsp; (We did not have the military frequency crystals in
our transmitter to work Brookley Tower.)
</p>
<p class="int1">
Just after this exchange, the object began to maneuver.&nbsp; It darted
hither and yon, rising and falling in undulating flight, making
sharper turns than any known aircraft, sometimes changing direction
90 degrees in an instant.&nbsp; All the while the color remained constant,
a brilliant blue-white, and the object did not grow or lessen in
size.&nbsp; Macintosh and I sat there completely flabbergasted at this
unnerving exhibition.&nbsp; I thought of calling the passengers over the
public address system, but the object was dead ahead of us and
putting on its performance in an area whose arc was not large
enough to enable anybody in the cabin to get a view of it out the
side windows.&nbsp; After a half minute or so of this dancing, unorthodox
flight the object suddenly became motionless and hovered dead still.&nbsp;
We were simply confounded by this.
</p>
<p class="int1">
Bates Tower called back, "Capital 77, we are trying to raise the
Brookley Tower."
</p>
<p class="int1">
Right at this moment the strange light began another series of
crazy gyrations, lazy 8's, square chandelles, all the while weaving
through the air with a sort of rythmic (sic), undulating cadence,
the likes of which neither Pete nor I had ever seen.&nbsp; Then,
apparently content at the consternation which it had wrought, the
object shot out ever the Gulf of Mexico, rising at the most
breathtaking angle and at such a fantastic speed that it diminished
rapidly to a pinpoint and was swallowed up in the night.&nbsp; This
unearthly exhibition probably went on for at least two minutes,
according to our best judgment.&nbsp; I glanced at the clock and noted it
read 10:12. The most puzzling thing about the whole occurrence,
aside from the dancing flight, was that the object, whatever it was,
had remained at the same distance from us throughout the
performance.&nbsp; How do we know this? It never increased in size, and
yet we were bearing down on it at more than 5 miles a minute in the
Viscount.&nbsp; If it was in view two minutes and performing in one area
we should have been at least ten miles closer to it.&nbsp; How, any
object that flies certainly looks different when viewed at such a
great variance in distance. So this UFO must have managed to remain
at the same distance from us throughout the entire display.
</p>
<p class="int1">
If you know southern Alabama you know that it is pretty desolate
country, with few inhabitants and only a few small hamlets between
Mobile and Montgomery up in the middle of the state.&nbsp; We were above
the clouds, precluding any reflections of searchlights from below.&nbsp;
I have seen hundreds of advertising searchlights playing on clouds,
and this was nothing remotely related.&nbsp; Likewise I am summarily
ruling out aircraft (at least the ones we know), balloons, missiles,
or any other earth launched device within my ken.&nbsp; The one thing
which I can't get over is the fact that when it came, <b>it came
steeply downwards</b>; when it departed after its amazing exhibition, <b>it
went steeply upward</b>!&nbsp; Now I ask you, John, is this machine based on
the earth?"
</p>
<p class="int1">
I followed up on this spectacular sighting after landing at Mobile.&nbsp;
The control tower operators had reached Brookley after a slight
delay, but the controller had seen nothing, and since no night
flights were in progress, the surveillance radar had not been
energized at the time.
</p>
<p class="int1">
In case any of your members would like to know my background, you
may give it to them.&nbsp; You will remember me as objectively skeptical
and cynically critical of most of the purported saucer sightings.&nbsp;
But I think you have to believe a veteran airline pilot with 17
years of service, 15,000 hours and 3 million miles in his log-book.&nbsp;
I am seeking no publicity.&nbsp; I didn't report this sighting to the
press and not a word has ever been printed about it until this
moment.
