Martin Shough:
561200  Far East  Asia  December 1956, A,V: This one appears to be pending and without clear date 
and details.  Could it be the Dec 17 1956 airborne radar-visual onear Tsushima, between S Korea 
and Japan?

Dec. 17, 1956; Near Itazuke AFB, Japan
At 3:20 p.m. local time, an object was picked up on airborne radar of an F-86D aircraft at 20 
nautical miles. The aircraft had a lock-on at 15 nautical miles on a steady overtake on a course 
of 270 degrees at 600 to 700 knots. The object and the observing aircraft were heading 270 degrees 
through the entire chase. A visual contact was made at 8 nautical miles and the F-86 closed to 
within 5 nautical miles and could not close any further. The object then started to pull away 
from the F-86 and at 12 nautical miles all indications on radar disappeared. The pilot estimated 
the speed of the object upon radar disappearance at 1500 to 1800 knots. Observation times were, 
radar: 7-8 minutes, visual: 3-4 minutes. The object was described as tan in color and round on 
top. Interference resembling ECM was experienced by both the observing aircraft and wingman. 
The general area of observation was 34-00N, 131-00E, slightly east of the Japanese island of 
Tsushima.
